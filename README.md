goal:implement K-Means & K-Means++ on two different datasets. One is 13 dimensional and numerical. The other is both numerical and categorical. 
We need to first preprocess data and use PCA to reduce dimensions.
Then use definition of the algorithm to implement. The clustering results are plotted by matplotlib.
Specific detail can be seen CS565-Project1.pdf
